TODO:
* post sorting doesnt work 
* something cool for the homepage (webgl related or something interactive maybe a game?) Incorporate about me there as well
* break blog posts and blog tags out into their own components
* links in blog posts aren't visible due to global link styling
* add mobile support (colapse top nav right among other things)
* back button on blog posts, retains active_tags if used, else defaults to all posts
* order tags in decending order by amount of posts in tag
* dark mode toggle
* search blog posts
* only show n tags, reveal more with "show more" button (or some other method tdb)
* projects page
